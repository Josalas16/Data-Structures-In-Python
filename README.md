# Data Structures & Algorithms In Python
## Lab 1
###### The purpose of this lab was to be able to draw figures/fractals recursively


## Lab 2
###### This lab contains Bubble, Merge and Quick Sort in which it thenreturns the element in the middle

## Lab 3
###### Testing knowledge and skills on Binary Search Trees (BST) and various implementations

## Lab 4
###### Testing knowledge and skills on B-Trees and comapring the differences with Binary Search Trees

## Lab 5
###### Comparing Binary Search Trees And an implementation of Hash Tables with Chaining


## Lab 6
###### Contains disjoint set forests, which we then had to build a maze with cells being contained within each other, used standard union and means of compression, each one creates a single path
